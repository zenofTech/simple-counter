## Deploy

Want this for your repository? Simply upload the [`index.php`](/index.php) to any web server with PHP installed.

> **Note**
> You may need to manually create the `views.txt` file adjacent to the `index.php` and enable write permissions for it depending on your server configuration.

> **Warning**
> Heroku is not recommended for hosting this project since it has an ephemeral file system and will remove the `views.txt` when the source code is refreshed.
